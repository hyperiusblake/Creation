    <div class="sub-title"> A Celebration of Music, Art, and Life</div><br>

    <div class="about">Creation is a festival about celebrating the beauty of life,
        mixing up “scenes”, and providing a safe space for marginalized individuals
        to gather and showcase themselves freely.<br><br>

        A portion of the funds generated at Creation events will be donated to
        a local organization that aligns with our values, which are as follows: the prioritization and
        uplifting of underserved communities, accessibility to art regardless of financial standing or location,
        equity for all, and the endorsement of mass social change.<br><br>

        No racism, homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, or hatefulness of any kind
        will be tolerated. Creation is meant to foster a sense of community in the city between not only artists,
        but art enthusiasts and appreciators alike.</div>
