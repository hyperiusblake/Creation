    <div class="about">Creation is a festival about celebrating the beauty of life,
         mixing up “scenes”, and providing a safe space for marginalized individuals 
         to gather and showcase themselves freely.<br><br>
         
        A portion of the funds generated at Creation events will be donated to 
        a local organization that aligns with our values, which are as follows: the prioritization and 
        uplifting of underserved communities, accessibility to art regardless of financial standing or location,
        equity for all, and the endorsement of mass social change.<br><br>

        No racism, homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, or hatefulness of any kind 
        will be tolerated. Creation is meant to foster a sense of community in the city between not only artists,
        but art enthusiasts and appreciators alike.</div><br><hr><br>
